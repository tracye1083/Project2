Training is awesome and she came back a completely different dog. The whole staff at the barking dog does such a great job and they are all so friendly and take great care of my dog! Going to be going to this place for a very long time. Highly recommend!",

        reviewBody: "We worked with Jocelyn and her training package and had excellent results! We are a very busy family and this program was designed for us! Having the ability to drop Rosie off to be trained during the days, followed by two one on one training consultations at whatever times we could make work was perfect! She provided the initial leg work as well as a very specific direction/training to follow at home. It is exactly what our family was looking for!",

        reviewBody: "Our dog loves going here. We get helpful reports every days he goes. He's an energetic pup who likes to rumble and although smaller they've placed with bigger dogs.  This actually has helped him at home. The staff are way more pleasant and trained than at Gail Fishers All Day Dogs other than one employee named Sarah. At the Barking Dog they all can do each job.  And they know where to hold the leash...know to turn their back if the dogs jump...and do not reward negative behavior! And the price is so reasonable! Thank you for taking care of Scooby for us!",

Customer service is great, the quality of the medical service is great, and they don't try to get your money by doing unnecessary test. Since we started coming here a month ago, everytime I open the door of my car my dogs jump in and I have a difficult time getting them out.",
