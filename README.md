## Description

You’ve heard of services like Angie’s List, well we wanted to make Puphub the “Angie’s List” for dog related services! Every dog owner goes through the struggles of finding a good vet, or groomer etc and when owners meet up they always dish the deets verbally so why not give them a platform to let their voices be heard by all!We have provided a site that you can easily search and review local dog related companies.
